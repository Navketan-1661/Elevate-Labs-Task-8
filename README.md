Step 1: Choose and Register for a Free VPN Service
Go to the official website of a reputable free VPN like Proton VPN.

Sign up for a free account using your email address.

Step 2: Download and Install the VPN Client
Download the VPN app for your device (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, or Linux) from the provider’s website or official app store.

Install the app by following the on-screen instructions.

Step 3: Open the VPN App and Sign In
Launch the installed VPN app.

Log in with the account you created in step 1.

Step 4: Connect to a VPN Server
In the app, choose a server location (the nearest server is usually the fastest).

Click or tap “Connect.”

Step 5: Verify Your IP Address Has Changed
While connected to the VPN, go to whatismyipaddress.com in your browser.

Check that your IP address and location are different from your real ones.

Step 6: Check Internet Access & Encryption
Browse any website to confirm internet access works.

All traffic between your device and the VPN server is now encrypted and secure.

Step 7: Disconnect the VPN and Compare
In the VPN app, click “Disconnect.”

Refresh whatismyipaddress.com to confirm your real IP is restored.

Notice that your internet speed may be faster when disconnected, as traffic is no longer being routed through the VPN.

Step 8: Review and Research Privacy/Encryption
In the VPN provider’s settings or on their website, review information about:

Encryption protocol (e.g., AES-256).

Privacy policy (look for “no-logs” statements).

Any built-in security safeguards (like a kill switch).
